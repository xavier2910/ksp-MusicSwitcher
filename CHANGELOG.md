# Changelog for MusicSwitcher

## Unreleased

- Takes over stock music and replaces it with your own. Currently all scenes except Flight have their stock music
  left alone.
- Flight music may be configured in .cfg files using a variety of controllers, including:
  - replacing stock in-space music
  - running different playlists when the active vessel is in different situations
  See [the configuring docs](CONFIGURING.md) for more info.
- Track fading on transitions and pauses is very doable and done.
