# MusicSwitcher
Plugin to change the music in Kerbal Space Program.
Compatible with version 1.12.5. Presumably compatible with some amount of earlier versions but I don't
have them (or KSP on Steam) so I can't test it out.

## Configuring

MusicSwitcher is meant to be configurable for a variety of dynamic styles and/or planet packs. See the
[configuring document](CONFIGURING.md) for more details on configuration. Right now there are not tons
of options, but more are on the way.
